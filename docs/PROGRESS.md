## M0 — Decisions & Prep `[SUBMISSION]`

### Phase 0 — Confirm open decisions
Status: COMPLETE
- [x] D1 — session lifetimes (idle / absolute) decided: 30 minutes / 12 hours
- [x] D2 — Include minimal AuditEvent table and audit writes in MVP
- [x] D3 — nginx selected as the production reverse proxy
- [x] D4 — lightweight query helpers selected; services remain primary
- [x] Record all four in MY_WORKFLOW.md ADR log
- [x] Record decisions in `MY_WORKFLOW.md`
- [x] Commit the completed phase

Completion evidence:
- Tests: — (decision and documentation phase; no tests required)
- Manual verification: D1–D4 each have a recorded choice, rationale, and consequence.
- Commit: `639e578 docs: record session lifetime, audit, proxy, and repository decisions`
- Notes: Local Git repository initialized; default branch renamed to `main`.

---

## M1 — Repo & Backend Foundation `[SUBMISSION]`

### Phase 1 — Repository structure & tooling
Status: COMPLETE
- [x] Select uv for environment and dependency management
- [x] Create backend package skeleton directories
- [x] Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtual environment
- [x] Pin core dependencies with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
- [x] Add Ruff formatter + linter configuration and run both checks
- [x] Add `.gitignore` (ignore `.env`, caches, build artifacts)
- [x] Initialize git; first commit (completed during Phase 0)
- [x] Confirm pytest collects zero tests without import or collection errors
- [x] Add backend, application-package, and test-suite guides
- [x] Record decisions and learning notes in `MY_WORKFLOW.md`
- [x] Commit the completed phase

Completion evidence:
- Tests: `pytest --collect-only` found zero tests without collection errors (expected exit code 5).
- Manual verification: `import app` succeeded; all dependency imports succeeded; Ruff reported 14
  files formatted and all lint checks passing; `.venv` and secret env files are ignored.
- Commit: `9abc2a1 chore: initialize backend structure and tooling`
- Notes: Runtime and development dependencies are separated; exact versions are stored in
  `uv.lock`. No application behavior exists yet.

### Phase 2 — FastAPI app + health endpoint
Status: COMPLETE
- [x] Create the FastAPI app instance
- [x] Add `GET /api/health` router
- [x] Include the router under `/api`
- [x] Run with uvicorn locally
- [x] Add health integration test
- [x] Record decisions and learning notes in `MY_WORKFLOW.md`
- [x] Commit the completed phase

Completion evidence:
- Tests: `1 passed, 1 warning`; Ruff format and lint checks passed across `app` and `tests`.
- Manual verification: Uvicorn started on `127.0.0.1:8000`; `/api/health` returned HTTP 200 with
  `{"status":"ok"}`; `/docs` returned HTTP 200; OpenAPI included `/api/health`.
- Commit: `feat(api): add FastAPI app and /api/health endpoint`
- Notes: FastAPI emitted a deprecation warning for the legacy TestClient/httpx integration; tracked
  as technical debt. This endpoint is liveness-only and intentionally does not check a database.

### Phase 3 — Configuration & environment variables
Status: COMPLETE
- [x] Define the `Settings` model (SPEC §18 vars)
- [x] Provide a single cached settings accessor
- [x] Write `.env.example`
- [x] Confirm `.env` is git-ignored
- [x] Add settings unit tests
- [x] Record decisions and learning notes in `MY_WORKFLOW.md`
- [x] Commit the completed phase

Completion evidence:
- Tests: `6 passed, 1 existing warning`; Ruff format and lint checks passed.
- Manual verification: `.env.example` loaded as `development` with D1 defaults; database URL and
  session secret were redacted; blank `COOKIE_DOMAIN` normalized to `None`; `.env` is ignored while
  `.env.example` remains trackable.
- Commit: `feat(config): add env-driven settings and .env.example`
- Notes: No real `.env` or secrets were created. FastAPI's existing TestClient warning remains
  tracked as Phase 2 technical debt.

---

## M2 — Database `[SUBMISSION]`

### Phase 4 — SQLAlchemy engine, session, base, DB dependency
Status: COMPLETE
- [x] Create the engine from `DATABASE_URL` (sized pool)
- [x] Create the `SessionLocal` factory
- [x] Declare the `Base` / metadata
- [x] Add the `get_db` dependency
- [x] Add connectivity check + test
- [x] Record decisions in `MY_WORKFLOW.md`
- [x] Commit the completed phase

Completion evidence:
- Tests: `12 passed, 1 existing warning`; Ruff format and lint checks passed.
- Manual verification: Compose configuration validated; PostgreSQL 16 reached healthy status on
  host port 5433; initialization logs contained no errors; `simulated_banking_dev` and
  `simulated_banking_test` exist and are owned by non-superuser `banking_user`; the role connected
  to and created/dropped schema objects in both databases; the runtime engine connected to the
  development database; database tests used only the isolated test database and proved cleanup
  plus rollback behavior.
- Commit: `fea719f feat(db): add Docker PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy session infrastructure`
- Notes: PostgreSQL alone runs in Docker; FastAPI remains local. The official image's bootstrap
  administrator is separate from the least-privilege application role. Initialization SQL runs
  only for an empty Compose volume. Alembic remains Phase 6 and was not initialized.

### Phase 5 — Database models & relationships
Status: COMPLETE
- [x] User model
- [x] Session model (token_hash unique, indexes)
- [x] Account model (`CHECK (balance >= 0)`, index)
- [x] Transaction model (append-only, index)
- [x] Transfer model
- [x] AuditEvent model (per D2)
- [x] Wire relationships and register on metadata
- [x] Add model unit tests
- [x] Record decisions in `MY_WORKFLOW.md`
- [ ] Commit the completed phase

Completion evidence:
- Tests: `16 passed, 1 existing warning`; Ruff format and lint checks passed.
- Manual verification: SQLAlchemy mapper configuration completed without relationship errors;
  `Base.metadata` registered exactly `users`, `sessions`, `accounts`, `transactions`, `transfers`,
  and `audit_events`, with required columns, named enums, indexes, foreign keys,
  `NUMERIC(14,2)` money types, timezone-aware timestamps, uniqueness, and the nonnegative-balance
  check represented in metadata.
- Commit:
- Notes: Integer primary keys were selected because the specification does not require UUIDs.
  Models deliberately have no implicit delete cascades. No tables or migrations were created;
  Alembic and live constraint enforcement remain Phase 6.

## Submission readiness checklist (SPEC §21)
- [ ] 1. Demo customer & admin login; cookie `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite=Strict`
- [ ] 2. Customer: accounts/balances/history; deposit, withdraw, transfer; correct balances
- [ ] 3. Over-balance withdraw/transfer → `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`; no change
- [ ] 4. Inactive/frozen ops rejected; same-account transfer rejected
- [ ] 5. Mid-transfer failure leaves both balances unchanged (test)
- [ ] 6. Concurrent withdrawals cannot overdraw (test); `CHECK (balance >= 0)` holds
- [ ] 7. Stored balance == signed sum of transactions (reconciliation test)
- [ ] 8. Customer cannot reach others' accounts (404) or admin (403)
- [ ] 9. Logout invalidates session server-side; deactivation revokes sessions
- [ ] 10. State-changing request without valid CSRF → `CSRF_INVALID`
- [ ] 11. Admin lists/opens/deactivates customer, freezes account; admin not an owner
